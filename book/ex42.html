<h1>Exercise 42: Is-A, Has-A, Objects, and Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-42-is-a-has-a-objects-and-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>An important concept that you have to understand is the difference between a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt> and an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt>.  The problem is, there is no real &quot;difference&quot; between a
class and an object.  They are actually the same thing at different points in
time.  I will demonstrate by a Zen koan:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">What</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">difference</span> <span class="pre">between</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">Fish</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">Salmon?</span></tt></p>
<p>Did that question sort of confuse you? Really sit down and think about it for a
minute.  I mean, a Fish and a Salmon are different but, wait, they are the same
thing right?  A Salmon is a <em>kind</em> of Fish, so I mean it's not different.  But
at the same time, becase a Salmon is a particular <em>type</em> of Fish and so it's actually
different from all other Fish.  That's what makes it a Salmon and not a
Halibut.  So a Salmon and a Fish are the same but different.  Weird.</p>
<p>This question is confusing because most people do not think about real things
this way, but they intuitively understand them.  You do not need to think about
the difference between a Fish and a Salmon because you <em>know</em> how they are
related.  You know a Salmon is a <em>kind</em> of Fish and that there are other kinds of
Fish without having to understand that.</p>
<p>Let's take it one step further, let's say you have a bucket full of 3 Salmon
and because you are a nice person, you have decided to name them Frank, Joe, and
Mary.  Now, think about this question:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">What</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">difference</span> <span class="pre">between</span> <span class="pre">Mary</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">Salmon?</span></tt></p>
<p>Again this is a weird question, but it's a bit easier than the Fish vs.
Salmon question.  You know that Mary is a Salmon, and so she's not really
different.  She's just a specific &quot;instance&quot; of a Salmon.  Joe and Frank are also
instances of Salmon. But, what do I mean when I say instance?  I mean they were
created from some other Salmon and now represent a real thing that has Salmon-like
attributes.</p>
<p>Now for the mind bending idea:  Fish is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt>, and Salmon is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt>, and
Mary is an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt>.  Think about that for a second.  Alright let's break it
down real slow and see if you get it.</p>
<p>A Fish is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt>, meaning it's not a <em>real</em> thing, but rather a word we attach
to instances of things with similar attributes.  Got fins? Got gills? Lives in
water?  Alright it's probably a Fish.</p>
<p>Someone with a Ph.D. then comes along and says, &quot;No my young friend, <em>this</em> Fish
is actually <em>Salmo salar</em>, affectionately known as a Salmon.&quot;  This professor
has just clarified the Fish further and made a new <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt> called &quot;Salmon&quot; that
has more specific attributes.  Longer nose, reddish flesh, big, lives in the ocean or
fresh water, tasty?  Ok, probably a Salmon.</p>
<p>Finally, a cook comes along and tells the Ph.D., &quot;No, you see this Salmon right
here, I'll call her Mary and I'm going to make a tasty fillet out of her with
a nice sauce.&quot;  Now you have this <em>instance</em> of a Salmon (which also is an
instance of a Fish) named Mary turned into something real that is filling your
belly.  It has become an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt>.</p>
<p>There you have it: Mary is a kind of Salmon that is a kind of Fish.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt> is
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt> is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-this-looks-in-code">
<h2>How This Looks In Code<a class="headerlink" href="#how-this-looks-in-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a weird concept, but to be very honest you only have to worry about it
when you make new classes, and when you use a class.  I will show you two
tricks to help you figure out whether something is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Class</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt>.</p>
<p>First, you need to learn two catch phrases &quot;is-a&quot; and &quot;has-a&quot;.  You use the
phrase is-a when you talk about objects and classes being related to each other
by a class relationship.  You use has-a when you talk about objects and classes
that are related only because they <em>reference</em> each other.</p>
<p>Now, go through this piece of code and replace each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">##??</span></tt> comment with a
replacement comment that says whether the next line represents an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-a</span></tt> or a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">has-a</span></tt> relationship, and what that relationship is.  In the beginning of the
code, I've laid out a few examples, so you just have to write the remaining
ones.</p>
<p>Remember, is-a is the relationship between Fish and Salmon, while has-a is the
relationship between Salmon and Gills.</p>

<h3>About class Name(object)<a class="headerlink" href="#about-class-name-object" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Remember how I was yelling at you to always use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span> <span class="pre">Name(object)</span></tt> and I couldn't
tell you why?  Now I can tell you, because you just learned about the difference between
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> and an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">object</span></tt>.  I couldn't tell you until now because you would have
just been confused and couldn't learn to use the technology.</p>
<p>What happened is Python's original rendition of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> was broken in many serious
ways.  By the time they admitted the fault it was too late, and they had to support
it.  In order to fix the problem, they needed some &quot;new class&quot; style so that the
&quot;old classes&quot; would keep working but you could use the new more correct version.</p>
<p>This is where &quot;class is-a object&quot; comes in.  They decided that they would use the
word &quot;object&quot;, lowercased, to be the &quot;class&quot; that you inherit from to make a class.
Confusing right?  A class inherits from the class named object to make a class but
it's not an object really it's a class, but do not forget to inherit from object.</p>
<p>Exactly. The choice of one single word meant that I couldn't teach you about this
until now.  Now you can try to understand the concept of a class that is an
object if you like.</p>
<p>However, I would suggest you do not.  Just completely ignore the idea of old style
vs. new style classes and assume that Python always requires (object) when you
make a class.  Save your brain power for something important.</p>
